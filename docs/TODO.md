# TODO / known issues

- `generate.py` CLI supports Z-Image Turbo only (no FLUX, no LTX).
- Single-pass generate sends only slot #1's mask (`slotsToParams()`); per-slot masks need Iterate Masks.
- Per-slot strength never reaches the backend in single-pass or LTX keyframes (all 1.0 / global `img_strength`).
- No CLIP loader: text encoders are bundled per model and load at model-load time.
- FLUX outpaint fill can seam (edit mode copies the ref). Candidate: `fal/flux-2-klein-4B-outpaint-lora` (green border + "Fill the green spaces according to the image"), 4B only; no maintained 9B equivalent (only merged checkpoint `24aittl/klein-9b-outpaint`, NC license).
- Guidance slider is hidden: unhide when a non-distilled full-precision model is added.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx:18` fails eslint `react-refresh/only-export-components` (pre-existing).
- `.tmp_uploads/` grows without cleanup.
